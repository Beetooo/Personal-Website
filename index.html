                <p>Hi, my name is Beto Santos Pyne, thanks for visiting my personal website! I am a high school student at Western Technical Commercial School. Next year I will be at Simon Fraer University to pursue a career in computer science. On this site you will find some of my past coding projects and I hope to update it as I develop my coding skills with future projects.</p>

                            <h2>Color Flow</h2>
                            <p>This is my most recent project and the one I most proud. I is a java app based on the popular mobile game Flow Free in which you are given a board with pairs of colored dots that you have to connect to each other without crossing over any paths or leaving any spots empty. I looks simple but making sure each ramdomly generated board was possible was very challenging, getting the hints to work and the drawing mechanism was also very challenging. I learned a lot about object oriented programing, java swing graphics, and navigating through 2d arrays.</p>

                            <h2>Typing Test</h2>
                            <p>This project I made in collaboration with Szymon Bocson (<a href="https://github.com/MangoMunky">Github</a>) it is a java typing test app made with java's swing framework, it randomly generates a list of words that the user then has to try to type as many of the words as they can before the time limit, they are then given a WPM score and an accuracy score. It has options for easy wordsets, hard wordsets, and even spanish. This project taught me the basics of java swing and a lot about working collaboratively on a project.</p>

                            <h2>Recipe Scraper</h2>
                            <p>I had the idea for a website a while ago that would allow the user to put in any ingredients they wanted and return all the recipes they could make based on the ingredients they had. I initially had a lot of difficulty getting all the recipes, I was trying to webscrape them but ran into issues with inconsistent layouts on the sites I was searching, I ended up not working on this project for about a year but finally decided to come back to it and I ended up getting it to work. This project still needs many features added for it to be what I envisioned, but I think it was a really good idea and I'm glad I made it work and learned a lot about webscraping in the process.</p>

                            <h2>Wordle Game</h2>
                            <p>This project hold a special place in my heart as my first memorable project, it is a Wordle game that I made in grade 10 as I was first learning python. I made it using python and a module called Pygame. This is not the most difficult project I have ever done, but it took me a while because it is long and I had to learn Pygame. In the end, I think the final product turned out pretty well, although if I were to do it again there would be a few things I would change. It could be written much more efficiently, and it could use a few quality of life features, such as the possible words consisting of only common words and a visual keyboard to indicate what letter have and haven't been used.</p>
